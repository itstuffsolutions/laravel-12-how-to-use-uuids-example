# Laravel 12 UUIDs: Generate, Configure & Use UUIDs, ULIDs & Ordered UUIDs
![ULID Example](https://itstuffsolutiotions.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/laravel-uuid-example.jpg)

🚀 **Boost your Laravel apps** with globally unique identifiers—covering UUID v4, ULID, and Ordered UUID (UUID v7). Learn when and how to implement each for enhanced security, performance, and scalability.

##  What You’ll Learn

- **UUIDs (v4)** — Random, globally unique IDs perfect for preventing ID enumeration and improving security.
- **ULIDs** — Compact, lexicographically sortable, URL-friendly identifiers.
- **Ordered UUIDs (UUID v7)** — Time-ordered, high-performance IDs that improve database indexing and write speed.

Dive into how to set them up using **Laravel 12 migrations**, **Eloquent traits (HasUuids & HasUlids)**, and simple **controller methods**. 

## Why UUIDs Matter in Laravel

- **Security & privacy**: Random or non-sequential IDs help prevent attackers from guessing resource counts.
- **Global uniqueness**: Ideal for distributed systems where merging or syncing across databases matters.
- **Performance-friendly**: Ordered UUIDs significantly reduce index fragmentation and optimize large table inserts. 

## Quick Guide

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1⃣ | **Create UUID-based migration**: `<code>$table->uuid('id')->primary();</code>` 
| 2⃣ | **Use HasUuids or HasUlids trait in your model** to auto-generate IDs. 
| 3⃣ | **Customize UUID generation** via `newUniqueId()` for specific behaviors like UUID v4. 
| 4⃣ | **Choose your ID format** depending on your use case:
<ul>
<li>Use `Str::uuid()` for random UUIDs</li>
<li>Use `Str::orderedUuid()` (UUID v7) for better indexing</li>
<li>Use ULIDs with `HasUlids` trait for short, URL-safe IDs</li>
</ul>
